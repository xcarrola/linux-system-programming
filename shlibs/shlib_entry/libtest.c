/* libtest.c

   By default, executables have an entry point (whose name is "main" by
   default), but shared libraries do not.  However, we can mark a function
   inside the shared library as an entry point using the --entry (-e)
   linker option.  Having done this, we can then execute the shared library
   in the same way that we would an executable, in which case the entry point
   function of the library executed.  This technique is used by a few
   standard libraries, such as glibc. To determine if a shared library
   supports this functionality, you can inspect the shared library using
   something like the following to check whether the library has a ".interp"
   ELF section:

        readelf --section-headers <library> | grep '\.interp'

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/* When we execute the entry point function of the shared library, the
   library must be dynamically linked in the same manner as an executable.
   When building an executable, the static linker (ld(1)) automatically
   creates an ELF ".interp" section that specifies the standard dynamic
   linker as the program interpreter. However, this does not happen by
   default when we build a shared library. Therefore, we use the
   gcc "__attribute__((section(".interp")))" feature to explicitly specify
   the creation of a ".interp" section that names the dynamic linker. */

#ifndef INTERP

        /* Unless a pathname is provided on the command line, we'll
           assume an x86-64 system and use the standard pathname of
           the dynamic linker on that architecture. */
