Demonstrate how to transition from a library that doesn't use symbol
versioning to a library that does use symbol versioning.

The shell script builds two binaries:

p1	Linked against non-symbol-versioned library
p2	Linked against symbol-versioned library

When p1 is run, it uses the "base" version of the symbol from the
symbol-versioned library. (The "base" version is the one identified
by Index 1 and 2 in the library's .gnu.version_d section; see
https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/symbol-versioning.)
