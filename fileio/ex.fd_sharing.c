/* fd_sharing.c

   Demonstrate that duplicate file descriptors share the file
   offset and file status flags by writing a program that:

   * Opens a file and duplicates the resulting file descriptor, to
     create a second file descriptor.
   * Displays the file offset and the state of the O_APPEND file
     status flag via the first file descriptor.
   * Changes the file offset and setting of the O_APPEND file status
     flag via the second file descriptor.
   * Displays the file offset and the state of the O_APPEND file
     status flag via the first file descriptor.
