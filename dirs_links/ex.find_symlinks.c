/* find_symlinks.c

   Write a program that uses nftw() to traverse the directory subtree
   specified in its command line (or the current working directory if
   no argument is supplied):

        find_symlinks [directory]

   The program should not dereference symbolic links (use FTW_PHYS). For
   each symbolic link that the program finds in the directory tree, the
   pathname of the symbolic link should be printed, along with the content
   (readlink()) of the symbolic link.
