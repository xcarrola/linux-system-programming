/* simple_atexit.c

   The atexit(3) function can be used to register one or more functions to
   be called at normal process exit. (These routines are not called if the
   process does an _exit(2) or if it is terminated by a signal)

   If more than one exit routine is registered, they are called
   in reverse order of registration.

   Usage: t_atexit [sleep-time]
                   Def = 0 secs
