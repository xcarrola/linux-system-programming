/* userns_cap_sig_expt.c

   Usage: userns_cap_sig_expt "[UID map record]" grandchild-UID

        Example: userns_cap_sig_expt "5 1000 10" 6

   This program creates a child (via clone(CLONE_NEWUSER)) and grandchild
   process (via fork()) that reside in a new user namespace. The first
   command-line argument is the 3-tuple (ID-inside-NS ID-outside-NS length)
   that defines the UID map for the new user namespace. (The GID map just
   maps the process's GID to the same value in the namespace.)

   The second command-line argument is a UID (relative to the new
   user namespace) that the grandchild process should adopt,
   via setresuid().

   The idea is that different users in the initial user namespace could
   try sending signals to the child and grandchild process. To do this
   requires either a UID match (following the rules described in kill(2))
   or that the sender has CAP_KILL in the target user namespace.

   Install this program with capabilities:

      setcap cap_setuid,cap_setgid,cap_dac_override=pe userns_cap_sig_expt

   This allows the program to:

   (a) Set up a UID record that has a length value that is greater than 1.
   (b) Write to map files that are owned by root. (The /proc/PID files for
       the processes created by this program will be owned by root:root,
       for the reasons described in the proc(5) manual page.)
